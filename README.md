# dbd-build-randomizer
A simple text-based tool for creating randomized builds for use in Dead By Daylight, an asymmetrical action-mutliplayer horror game by Behaviour Interactive (BHVR).

The content present in this randomizer is consistent with DBD Version 7.0.0 (Chapter 28: END TRANSMISSION (PTB)).

Event content (event items, offerings, add-ons, etc.) is not included in this randomizer. 
There are also no plans to include cosmetics for randomization, but the randomizer does include Legendary cosmetics (as well as some Very Rare cosmetics, like Alessa Gillespie) as an option for character selection 
(Example: for Jill Valentine, one version of the survivor randomization will just select Jill, while the other allows for Jill, Claire, or Sheva to be selected).
